Novelty - Measuring deviation from reference frames.

Novelty is not a property of concepts in isolation. It is the result of
a loop that measures how a concept relates to an agent's existing beliefs.
The termination reason IS the novelty measurement.

Key exports for integration with attention:

    from novelty import (
        # Core types
        NoveltyResult,
        Termination,
        Stance,
        ReferenceFrame,

        # Probes (the measurement loop)
        HybridProbe,
        NeuralProbe,

        # Frames (what you measure against)
        HybridFrame,
        NeuralFrame,

        # Convenience functions
        measure_against_claims,
        measure_hybrid_novelty,
    )

Quick usage:

    from novelty import measure_against_claims

    result = measure_against_claims(
        concept="Bitcoin",
        claim_texts=[
            "Traditional banking provides security",
            "Trust in institutions is necessary",
        ]
    )

    print(result.termination)  # Termination.CONTRADICTS_ROOT
    print(result.composite)    # 0.052 (novelty score 0-1)
